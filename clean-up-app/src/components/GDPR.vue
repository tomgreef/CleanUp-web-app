		<h3>
			Verifying your identity where you request access to personal
			information
		</h3>
		<p>
			Where you request access to personal information, we are required by
			law to use all reasonable measures to verify your identity before
			doing so. Where we possess appropriate information about you on
			file, we will attempt to verify your identity using that
			information. If it is not possible to identity you from such
			information, or if we have insufficient information about you, we
			may require original or certified copies of certain documentation in
			order to be able to verify your identity before we are able to
			provide you with access to your personal information.
		</p>
		<p>
			These steps are necessary to verify your identity in order to reduce
			the risk of identity fraud or identity theft by persons other than
			yourself asking for access to your personal information.

				to object to us using or processing your personal information

				<b
					>carry out a task in the public interest or for our
					legitimate interests</b
				>, including ‘profiling’ (i.e. predicting your behaviour based
				on your personal information) based on any of these purposes;
				and
			</li>
			<li>
				to object to us using or processing your personal information
				for <b>direct marketing purposes</b> (including any automated
				evaluation we make about you or any of your characteristics as a
				person, to the extent that it is related to such direct
				marketing).
			</li>
		</ol>

		<p>
			You may also exercise your right to object to us using or processing
			your personal information for direct marketing purposes by:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<b>clicking the unsubscribe link</b> contained at the bottom of
				any marketing email we send to you and following the

				by including the words “OPT OUT”.
			</li>
		</ol>

		<p>
			Whenever you object to direct marketing from us by a different
			communication method to that of the marketing communications you
			have received from us, you must provide us with your name and
			sufficient information to enable us to identify you in relation to
			the communications you have received (for example, if you have
			received text messages from us and you wish to unsubscribe by email,
			we may need you to provide us with your phone number in that email).

			statutory obligation (in order to be able to send you an invoice for

			to our Privacy Policy known to you by posting a notice on the

		<p>
			Where we intend to use your personal information for a new purpose

		<h3>Children’s Privacy</h3>
		<p>
			Because we care about the safety and privacy of children online, we
			comply with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998
			(COPPA). COPPA and its accompanying regulations protect the privacy
			of children using the internet. We do not knowingly contact or
			collect personal information from children under the age of 13. The
			website is not intended to solicit information of any kind from
			children under the age of 13.
		</p>

		<p>
			It is possible that we may receive information pertaining to
			children under the age of 13 by fraud or deception. If we are
			notified of this, as soon as we verify the information, we will
			immediately obtain the appropriate parental consent to use that
			information or, if we are unable to obtain such parental consent, we

		<h3>California Do Not Track Disclosures</h3>
		<p>
			“Do Not Track” is a privacy preference that users can set in their
			web browsers. When a user turns on a Do Not Track signal in their
			browser, the browser sends a message to websites requesting that
			they do not track the user. For information about Do Not Track,
			please visit

			>.
		</p>

		<p>
			At this time, we do not respond to Do Not Track browser settings or
			signals. In addition, we may use other technology that is standard
			to the internet, such as pixel tags, web beacons, and other similar
			technologies, to track visitors to the website, or one of the
			affiliated pages. Those tools may be used by us and by third parties
			to collect information about you and your internet activity, even if
			you have turned on the Do Not Track signal.
